# ðŸ’¸ Digital10K-Contract
The contract is simple and based on the EIP-712 standard which includes a customized transferWithPermit function. That enables users to perform gasless transfers by utilizing a signed permit signature. The transaction is then executed by a Relayer to transfer the token from the owner to the receiver.

## Implements

Added `transferWithPermit` function.
```javascript
function transferWithPermit(
    address owner,
    address receiver,
    uint256 value,
    uint256 deadline,
    uint8 v,
    bytes32 r,
    bytes32 s
) external {
    permit(owner, receiver, value, deadline, v, r, s);
}
```

On abstract `ERC20Permit`, the `permit` function changes `_approve` to `_transfer` to reduce steps to directly transfer.

```javascript
function permit(
    address owner,
    address receiver,
    uint256 value,
    uint256 deadline,
    uint8 v,
    bytes32 r,
    bytes32 s
) public virtual {
    ...

    // change _approve to _transfer to direct transfer to receiver
    _transfer(owner, receiver, value);
}
```

Use PERMIT_TYPEHASH with:
```javascript
bytes32 private constant PERMIT_TYPEHASH = keccak256("Permit(address owner,address receiver,uint256 value,uint256 nonce,uint256 deadline)");
```
